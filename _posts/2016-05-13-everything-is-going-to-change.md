I use to HATE it when people would always make this comment, "_everything is going to change_" when they noticed I was expecting... Like I was stupid or something, I knew my life was going to change and that everything was about to be different and new, once my little bundle of love would enter this world.... ..

..ok so.. I admit it... I really DIDN'T know just how much my life WOULD in fact change when i had my mini! I may have underestimated the impact of motherhood BUT i still cringe at the thought of the remark, "Everything is going to change...." ugh, I think it was the tone people used when saying it that bothered me the most, not the actual words themselves...

oh man, i hate to even say this but i'm such a hypocrite.. i actually caught myself saying those EXACT words, to a woman that was expecting a few weeks after I had my babes. After I said it out loud, i felt like i could kick my own ass! lol. seriously, What have I become?!?!? ..I guess motherhood does hit ya hard, sometimes without even knowing it.

Anywhoo, i just wanted to take a moment to share just how much becoming a mama does change. .yo.. life... and this is just a FEW of examples, it'd take me literally all day to go into too much detail and list everything that has changed.. (also, I apologize in advance for TMI ) !

1. ) Your Body: is much different from before (obviously)! how could it not be.. I'm 5 feet tall, my pre-pregnancy weight was between 105--108 & I was carrying 8lbs. & 60z.s of baby, oh and i gained close to 50 pounds during pregnancy..it looked like i was carrying twins (according to some outspoken strangers. JERKS)! So yes, things are a little fuller now(so are my boobs (.)(.)which is the only plus side of having a few extra pounds hanging around ;) And hey, it doesn't mean ya can't get your body back. I'm determined to getting my boo-tay back in shape! But for now I think I'll enjoy my more voluptuous figure since I am still breast feeding & well, it's only been 4 months, and its winter..and well I'm kinda tired these days, since I AM caring for a baby!
2. SEX --- "yes please!" ;) ha. so of course sex has changed a bit. Spontaneous sex sounds fun, doesn't it ? except, i don't know what that is anymore, unless its during the time the baby is already down for a nap or asleep for the night! does that still count as spontaneous?!?! also, take it sloooowww, I didn't even have a natural birth (c-section baby here)and it takes some time for sex to actually be pleasurable again. I can't even imagine what it'd be like if i did have to push a baby out from my lady part (ouchy). my other advice is to keep having sex with your spouse or significant other. never neglect his/her or your needs in that area. a baby is not an excuse to not get down! it should be the reason why you get it on!! ! !
3. Food.. I use to actually enjoy going grocery shopping, it was fun for some reason for me..kind of therapeutic. cooking is another joy of mine. These two things have definitely changed. grocery shopping is still enjoyable but now I do it from the convenience of my cellular device or computer. because guess what, Safeway delivery & Envoy grocery delivery are life savers! with a few magical clicks of a button, i choose what I want and voila, it shows up at my door when i want it to! it's pretty much amazing. cooking is tricky, I try and make dinner during the day because Eva's bedtime is between 6:30pm --- 7:30pm and i make a lot of soups (they are too easy not to make). or i just buy pre-made meals or order out! that works too! whatever, as long as i'm feeding my face and my hubby's! ☺
4. Doing pretty much anything.. takes a lot of planning, preparing & energy. Thank goodness one of my strengths is being organized and i must say that I am damn good at time management. You realize just how bad or good you are at time management when you have a baby. Yes, shit happens (literally) especially when you have a little one & in life in general, but being late for things is a HUGE pet-peeve of mine, so I try and not be late for anything or anyone! so far, so good. Haven't been late once in the past 4 months since Eva has been here! ..Then again I haven't done a WHOLE hell of a lot either, but still, i give myself kudos ! for real though, i even have to plan when Im going to work out on my Bowflex, AT HOME. That's crazy right?!?! oh well, maybe it's just me. I try and plan everything! haha.

Well, I'm glad i planned out when i was going to write this post because the baby is calling me (more like yelling) so this is where i must end.. hope you enjoyed and if you are a parent then you know a thing or two about what I shared & if you're not a parent then i hope i didn't scare you from procreating! It really is amazing, different, and _everything_ does change, but all worth it!

Ciao!
