my entire life, as i knew it, changed drastically. i found out i was pregnant in January, gave birth to a daughter in September, recovered from an intense delivery (physically & mentally), suffered from a mild yet scary form of postpartum depression that lasted for about a month, while also quitting my full time job of 3 years to be a stay-at-home mom. all of this was a huge adjustment yet the most difficult was learning how to live this new life of mine.

i remembering thinking, WHO AM I, NOW?

i was alive but at the same time i didn't feel as if i was fully living. i was searching for my bearrings, looking for familiarity in the unknown, learning how to mother another being, figuring out how to find balance, and getting to know not only my child but also getting to know myself again.

i felt as though i had to re-learn everything, what i once knew wasn't so anymore. not because 'it' changed, but because i changed. it was as though i was viewing the world through a new set of eyes. what once was important now seemed petty, what was simple now was a challenge.. nothing was the same to me. not even me. i felt like a foreigner in my own body.

i believe in the darkest times there is still a light that shines that leads to hope, sometimes you just have to find it and choose to follow it. . .

although i had some intense lows in 2014, i also experienced the best of highs! becoming a mother IS the hardest thing i've ever done, yet it IS also the best, most rewarding choice i've ever made. the hard times make me that much stronger and equip me that much more in being the best mama that i can be.

i like to think of this past year as a transitioning period for me, from a girl to a WOMAN!

i chose & continue to choose to get up, dust myself off, reinvent, and go again. i've come a long way and every trial and triumph has contributed to my growth. i have never felt better or more comfortable in my own skin. i am owning my life and taking charge of my future while thoroughly enjoying the chaos of motherhood. because without her i wouldn't be the woman i am today. she is the reason ❤

it's amazing what a year can do and how much can change and transform. i am **grateful** for all of it and i can truly see God's hand in every moment.

at 29 years young, i am taking new ground in all areas of my life. stepping out of my comfort zone, taking risks and declaring just WHO I AM, i believe is just the beginning to what's next!

so ...WHO AM I?

well, here's just a little of me...

i am ELIZABETH TOCCHINI HASKINS
