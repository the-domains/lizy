Have you ever loved someone to the point that the very thought of them could break your heart? Figuratively speaking of course, but _seriously_... have you ever allowed yourself to l❤ve another that thinking of them, like to REALLY think of them, could make you crumble to the floor and weep over all of their glory?

Sounds dramatic, I know. But who doesn't want an intense_dramatic_ kind of love!?!? I do! And I'm referring to the good kind of the drama (not that reality TV crap) I'm talking about the kind that sweeps you off your feet in an "OH -WOW" kind of way, the kind that comes from overflowing, unconstrained, passionate love!

**I've experienced this dramatic, intense kind of love...**

In fact, I had an overwhelming '_love episode'_ ← (that's what we will call it) today. Here's what happened, as I was about to hop in the shower, a photo of my husband from our wedding caught my eye. I couldn't help but to STOP and to notice HIM. there he was, _my_ husband, the father of our child, protector, provider, and all around bad-ass! I saw him in all his imperfect yet PERFECT ((at least to me)) glory!! ❤ ❤

As I stood there admiring this man of mine, suddenly 9 years of crazy beautiful memories flooded my vision, and I broke. The tears were unstoppable. I broke over the appreciation I had for him, I cried over the memories we share, the moments lost, and the hopeful future ahead. I felt the piercing pain of what it means to love so deeply.

true story. ❤

~ Our past memories continued to flash before me. I even saw the times we hurt each other, the moments of disconnection, the arguments, the _almost_breakups, that thankfully never happened. The hardships were just as vivid as the good times. Each memory is important to me, especially the hardships because we overcame them together and drew closer to each other as a result. What doesn't kill us can only make us stronger, right!?!? I believe that!

Back to my 'love episode,' I never hopped in that shower and the house choirs, still aren't done. See what love does to us, it makes us soft, sad and useless! (Ha!) But I'm okay with that, cause even though my hair and house is still a mess, the love I live in for my husband is **bigger** than all of that. That very love is what really matters. It's what changes lives.←(Thinking about our daughter❤)

I believe the way you love impacts more than just the person you're loving.

Love will be apart of my legacy. Not just the love I have for my husband, but the way I love in general. The love I keep for my family, my daughter and my friends is unmistakably known. It's passion mixed with punch. Selfless, loud, and well, probably annoying at times! It's wild and free, deep and strong. If I love you, then you know it, you don't have to guess it, you'll feel it, and you will hear it, because I'll let it be known! It's just the way I live and the way I Love.

No love is the same. You can't measure it, compare it, or duplicate it. Each love has a story that is unique, ever-changing, and beautifully crafted to it's own.

May the love you give and receive be fierce, without filter or thought, may it change you forever and may your heart be broken to a million pieces over and over again in the name of LOVE.
