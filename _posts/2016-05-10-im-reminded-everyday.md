Adjusting to parenthood is like relearning how to live! Everything I thought was important is now unimportant (ok, maybe not everything, but a whole hell of a lot has changed)!

I feel like a new me has been birthed through mothering my daughter. _If your a mother (or a father) then I'm sure you can relate. _I am learning and growing right along side of Eva. It's funny, I often think I'm teaching her all about life but I've realized that caring for her and just being with her, in her very presence, is teaching me much more than I could ever imagine...

She's teaching me more than what it means to be patient, what it means to love, and care for a child...she's my constant reminder of what life is really all about!

i'm continually reminded that life is about the little things, those LITTLE things are the ones that make the biggest difference...they're priceless & yet more valuable than gold...they are treasures of the soul...here are just a few...**Time.** Invest it in those who matter most to you. Put your money away, that's just paper & anyone can buy gifts, time is precious, more precious than gold if you ask me! and because time flies by, WAY TOO FAST, It's important to take the time to be with family & l❤ved ones (& your baby of course!) This time together is irreplaceable & priceless, it's when the best of moments are shared & the sweetest memories are made!

* **Laugh.** laugh A LOT! Laugh out loud! Laugh at yourself, _because no one is perfect and neither are you, _laugh with (or AT, haha!) your kid(_s), they are silly and hilarious and they don't care who's watchin'! _Laugh with (OR again, AT) your spouse/loved ones, _because they aren't perfect either!!_Share a good laugh with a friend, _they probably need it as much as you do!_Laughter is contagious, so go and spread it like a wild fire, it's the best "turn-that-frown-upside- down" kind of medicine!
* **'Kid around!'** Embrace your inner child and let him/her run free!Being a parent gives you license to be a kid again, so do it, don't hold back! If you must, then eat some plato_(no don't really, that's gross..ok just try a little, if you have too, lol), _get dirty, roll around in the mud, splash in puddles, play in the sandy box, let that hair done and get messy with your kids,_they will love you for it!_ Explore like never before, be creative! _But whatever you do, DON'T worry about how you look, because you're most definitely going to look ridiculous.._which is apart of the fun!
![Celebrate the life you live ](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5054ffa66a3a11c480f13b21c063df83fccf78ce.jpg)

* **CELEBRATE!** Find any reason to celebrate the life you live and celebrate with those who are on the ride of life with you! Heck, I celebrated the first night my baby slept in her own room, and the first time she slept for 9 hours straight, I even celebrated me and my husband going out for our first time _celebrating_ our first date!HA! You see, there is always something to be joyful about. _oh and celebrating can take any shape or form, sometimes it takes the form of going to bed early on a Friday night to get a good nights rest._ Whatever it is and however you choose to rejoice, doesn't matter, just CELEBRATE! It's your life, so make it sparkle! again, you're kids will love you for this! ❤
* **Savor** every moment. _Every. moment._ Try to enjoy all life throws at you, the good, bad, and the ugly. There is beauty in it all, sometimes you just have to search for it_, just think of it as a scavenger hunt! _☺ You only have one life and you're not promised tomorrow, so appreciate today.
* **Stop & be present.** You can't savor each and every second if you can't stop...and be present in the moment. Sometimes you need to leave the house a mess, let the laundry pile up and just unplug from the world to just BE present with your baby or your husband or your friend, or to even just BE alone. This may sound easy to do, but it often is the most difficult. There are so many distractions pulling us this-and-that way, that we often miss the beauty that's right in front of us... _I think NOW is a good time to practice this discipline, so STOP reading this & go be with your wife or husband or kids, or roommate, or boyfriend or girlfriend, or dog, or cat,...ok I think you get the point!. Even if the moment is brief, make it count & savor that precious time!_

I'm going to go practice what I preach...ciao! ☺
